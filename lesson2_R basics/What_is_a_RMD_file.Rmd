Speed and Stopping Distances of Cars
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document or RMD. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

```{r}
?cars
str(cars)
```

We can also embed plots, e.g.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)

```


When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
